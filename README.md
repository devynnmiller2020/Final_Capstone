This project reviews the MyPyramid Dataset (Data.Gov, 2019) in order to increase the options
and information provided for the companny Habit. Habit is a nutritional behavior 
company that focuses on the correlation between human dietary health with 
the help of genetic testing and behavioral questioning of its 
consumers. 

The project seeks to answer two main questions surrounding 
the calorie content of foods in relation to the vegetable contents and 
the distribution of calorie contents across various foods. In order to answer these questions, 
the MyPyramid Dataset (Data.Gov, 2019) is used, which highlights the caloric contents, 
portion sizes, and proportion of daily values commonly eaten foods have.
